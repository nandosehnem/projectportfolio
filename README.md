# Meet our TEAM of  Developers, FernandoSehnem, Oz TheWizardof, Branden and Paul Cloud
# Our current project consists of 4 javascript based games that users are able to play on a mini game hub. 

# Rules and instructions are provided by each developer and designed individually. 
# Each  developer has collaborated together to create an awesome gaming experience. 

# The games provided are the game of craps, sudoku, flexmath and memorygame.

# The MVP A mini gamehub where users can choose a different game out of 4 choices. 
#  Create 4 easily playable games that a user can choose from. 
# Create a introduction and readme file for the individual game. 
# Provide instructions, craft instructions on how the game is played / Provide pseudo code and develope a scheme.
# Ask what needs to be in the game consult with others and decide what the plan of action is. This is also providing feedback.
# Start coding and make a minimal draft for the game. 
# Test all functions and test for bugs.
# Update after testing.
# Once the single functionality of the game is developed work and collaborate with other team members to make sure the main application is functioning properly. 
# If Someone sees an opportunity to provide insight on code on another person's project or game, communicate and decided what will work best. 

# We will need to decide how long we need to spend on each part of the code. 

# Each developer should be able to copy from the remote branch of the individuals game and help to assist in creating the code and psuedo code if there are any changes. 

# A dummyBranch has been created for all changes that need to be made in real time and for bug testing and any mistakes or mess ups. This will be the only branch that can have pull requests changes and merges before final product to the main branch. 

# No pull requests for the main branch.
# The main branch will have the opening web page for the selelction of each game and will consist of a separate index.html and index.js files for compiling code.

# Reminder to use the javascript lessons to provide and include what we have and will learn over the course. 

# I have installed node modules and npm, bootstrap and sass. My nodeModules and bootstrap versions may be different from yours. 

# If there are any issues with npm node modules sass or bootstrap. I good thing to do is to remove the pre-exisiting node modules and then perform a npm init -y 
# install bootstrap again and sass. 

# bug tracking if someone finishes something someone else is testing it for errors. 

# GIT Instructions A MUST READ. 

# 1. git clone https://github.com/cloudpc7/projectportfolio.git

# 2. git checkout (branch name of the game, depending on which game your doing)

# 3. Make an edit "test" to the readme file first to verify commands work and we can push to the branch 

# 4. git push -u origin "branch name" NOT MAIN
